This addon is designed to enhance NVDA by adding the ability to disable reading typed characters on object types where there is no text field to edit. By enabling this addon, NVDA will only read the typed characters in text fields or editable content areas.
You can always toggle the addon on or off using the "NVDA+9" keyboard shortcut.
